/*17. What is the difference between a variable created on a stack and a variable created on the heap?

The memory on the stack is allocated at compile time, while the heap is allocated at runtime.

The memory on the stack will be automatically deleted when the block ends, the memory allocated on the heap must free itself (using free, delete)*/
