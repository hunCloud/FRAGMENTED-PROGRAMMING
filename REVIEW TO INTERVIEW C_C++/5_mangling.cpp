/* 5. What does the concept of name mangling in C ++ mean and why is it used?

In C ++, it supports overloading, so how do compiler compilations determine
 exactly which functions are called when they have the same name just different
  parameters.

To solve this problem, C ++ complier will change the name of the function
 by adding information about the parameter after the function name. That's
 called name mangling.
